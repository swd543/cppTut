# CPP tutorials
# Author: Swapneel Datta

This is intended to be a backup/tutorial for any of those who are stepping into the world of C++.
Do not hate on me if you find anything wrong, rather kindly put a pull request with any changes you might find. I'm also a noob!

I am creating these tutorials as I learn C++ concepts myself.

# Environment
I use eclipse-C++ on linux.

# Building and running
cd into Debug
run make
Run the project with ./<executable_name>
